My learning project to get started with GitHub and Travis CI.

## Goals

Make a simple executable that is built by Travis CI with:

* C++11 **(done)**
* gcc **(done)**
* CMake **(done)**
* building on linux **(done)**
* building on windows
* use CMake ExternalProject to add a 3rd party library to the build
